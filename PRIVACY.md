# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 18, 2025

This Privacy Policy applies to the **Gemini Folder Extension** (hereinafter referred to as "Extension") created by the developer (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider"). This service is intended for use "AS IS" and is provided as a Free service.

## Information Collection and Use

The Service Provider prioritizes your privacy. The Extension is designed to operate with minimal data access.

### 1. Website Content (Chat Titles & Metadata)
To provide the core folder management functionality, the Extension accesses specific **Website Content** on `gemini.google.com`.
* **Chat Titles:** We read the visible titles of your chats to display them in the folder sidebar.
* **Technical Identifiers (IDs & Metadata):** We read DOM attributes such as Chat IDs and timestamps. This information is strictly required to technically link your folders to the correct chat URLs and to handle sorting or syncing properly.
* **What we DO NOT access:** We **do not** read, collect, store, or analyze the actual content of your conversations (the prompts you send or the answers Gemini generates).

### 2. Data Storage
The Extension uses your browser's local and sync storage capabilities:
* **Local Data:** Cached chat metadata are stored locally on your device via `chrome.storage.local`.
* **Synced Data:** Your folder structure and color settings are synced across your devices using `chrome.storage.sync`. This data is handled by Google's encrypted sync infrastructure. The Service Provider does not have access to this data.

### 3. No Remote Data Collection
The Extension **does not** transmit any user data, website content, or usage analytics to external servers controlled by the Service Provider or any third parties. Your data remains strictly within your browser and your Google account.

## Third-Party Access

Since the Extension does not collect or transmit personal data to external servers, there is no data sharing with third parties.
* We **do not** sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information.
* We **do not** use third-party analytics services to track your browsing habits.

## Security

The security of your data relies on the security of your local device and your Google Account. Since data is stored via Chrome Sync, we recommend enabling 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) for your Google Account to ensure your synced data remains secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

The Service Provider may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

## Your Consent

By using the Extension, you signify your acceptance of this policy.
